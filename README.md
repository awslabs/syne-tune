This package provides state-of-the-art distributed hyperparameter optimizers (HPO) where trials 
 can be evaluated with several trial backend options (local backend to evaluate trials locally;
SageMaker to evaluate trials as separate SageMaker training jobs; a simulation backend to quickly benchmark parallel 
asynchronous schedulers).

## Installing

To install Syne Tune from pip, you can simply do:

```bash
pip install 'syne-tune'
```

This will install a bare-bone version. If you want in addition to install our own Gaussian process based optimizers, Ray Tune or Bore optimizer, 
you can run `pip install 'syne-tune[X]'` where `X` can be 
* `gpsearchers`: For built-in Gaussian process based optimizers
* `raytune`: For Ray Tune optimizers
* `benchmarks`: For installing all dependencies required to run all benchmarks
* `extra`: For installing all the above
* `bore`: For Bore optimizer
* `kde`: For KDE optimizer

For instance, `pip install 'syne-tune[gpsearchers]'` will install Syne Tune along with many built-in Gaussian process 
optimizers.

To install the latest version from git, run the following:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune.git
```

For local development, we recommend to use the following setup which will enable you to easily test your changes: 

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
git clone git@github.com:awslabs/syne-tune.git
cd syne-tune
pip install -e '.[extra]'
```

To run unit tests, simply run `pytest` in the root of this repository.

To run all tests whose name begins with `test_async_scheduler`, you can use the following
```bash
pytest -k test_async_scheduler
```


## Getting started

To enable tuning, you have to report metrics from a training script so that they can be communicated later to Syne Tune,
this can be accomplished by just calling `report(epoch=epoch, loss=loss)` as shown in the example bellow:

```python
# train_height.py
import logging
import time

from syne_tune import Reporter
from argparse import ArgumentParser

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = logging.getLogger()
    root.setLevel(logging.INFO)

    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--steps', type=int)
    parser.add_argument('--width', type=float)
    parser.add_argument('--height', type=float)

    args, _ = parser.parse_known_args()
    report = Reporter()

    for step in range(args.steps):
        dummy_score = (0.1 + args.width * step / 100) ** (-1) + args.height * 0.1
        # Feed the score back to Syne Tune.
        report(step=step, mean_loss=dummy_score, epoch=step + 1)
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

Once you have a script reporting metric, you can launch a tuning as-follow:

```python
from syne_tune import Tuner, StoppingCriterion
from syne_tune.backend import LocalBackend
from syne_tune.config_space import randint
from syne_tune.optimizer.baselines import ASHA

# hyperparameter search space to consider
config_space = {
    'steps': 100,
    'width': randint(1, 20),
    'height': randint(1, 20),
}

tuner = Tuner(
    trial_backend=LocalBackend(entry_point='train_height.py'),
    scheduler=ASHA(
        config_space, metric='mean_loss', resource_attr='epoch', max_t=100,
        search_options={'debug_log': False},
    ),
    stop_criterion=StoppingCriterion(max_wallclock_time=15),
    n_workers=4,  # how many trials are evaluated in parallel
)
tuner.run()
```

The above example runs ASHA with 4 asynchronous workers on a local machine.

## Examples

You will find the following examples in [examples/](examples/) folder illustrating different functionalities provided
by Syne Tune:
* [launch_height_baselines.py](examples/launch_height_baselines.py):
  launches HPO locally, tuning a simple script 
   [train_height_example.py](examples/training_scripts/height_example/train_height.py) for several baselines  
* [launch_height_ray.py](examples/launch_height_ray.py):
  launches HPO locally with [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/tune/index.html)
  scheduler
* [launch_height_moasha.py](examples/launch_height_moasha.py):
  shows how to tune a script reporting multiple-objectives with multiobjective Asynchronous Hyperband (MOASHA)
* [launch_height_standalone_scheduler.py](examples/launch_height_standalone_scheduler.py):
  launches HPO locally with a custom scheduler that cuts any trial that is not
  in the top 80%
* [launch_height_sagemaker_remotely.py](examples/launch_height_sagemaker_remotely.py):

  the remote machine or distributed again as separate SageMaker training jobs

  results of a HPO experiment

launches HPO locally tuning a multi-layer perceptron on Fashion MNIST. This
employs an easy-to-use benchmark convention
* [launch_huggingface_classification.py](examples/launch_huggingface_classification.py):
