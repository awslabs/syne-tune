This package provides state-of-the-art distributed hyperparameter optimizers (HPO) with the following key features:
* wide coverage (>20) of different HPO methods for asynchronous optimization with multiple workers, including:
  * advanced multi-fidelity methods supporting model-based decisions (BOHB and MOBSTER)
  * transfer-learning optimizers that achieve better and better performance when used repeatedly
  * multi-objective optimizers that can tune multiple objectives simultaneously (such as accuracy and latency)
* you can run HPO in different environments (locally, AWS, simulation) by changing one line of code
* out-of-the-box tabulated benchmarks available for several domains with efficient simulations that allows you 
  to get results in seconds while preserving the real dynamics of asynchronous or synchronous HPO with any
  number of workers

## Installing

To install Syne Tune from pip, you can simply do:

```bash
pip install 'syne-tune[extra]'
```

or to get the latest version from git: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune.git
cd syne-tune
python3 -m venv st_venv
. st_venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e '.[extra]'
```

This installs everything in a virtual environment `st_venv`. Remember to activate
this environment before working with Syne Tune. We also recommend building the
virtual environment from scratch now and then, in particular when you pull a new
release, as dependencies may have changed.

See our [change log](CHANGELOG.md) to see what changed in the latest version. 

## Getting started

To enable tuning, you have to report metrics from a training script so that they can be communicated later to Syne Tune,
this can be accomplished by just calling `report(epoch=epoch, loss=loss)` as shown in the example below:

```python
# train_height.py
import logging
import time

from syne_tune import Reporter
from argparse import ArgumentParser

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = logging.getLogger()
    root.setLevel(logging.INFO)

    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--steps', type=int)
    parser.add_argument('--width', type=float)
    parser.add_argument('--height', type=float)

    args, _ = parser.parse_known_args()
    report = Reporter()

    for step in range(args.steps):
        dummy_score = (0.1 + args.width * step / 100) ** (-1) + args.height * 0.1
        # Feed the score back to Syne Tune.
        report(step=step, mean_loss=dummy_score, epoch=step + 1)
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

Once you have a script reporting metric, you can launch a tuning as-follow:

```python
from syne_tune import Tuner, StoppingCriterion
from syne_tune.backend import LocalBackend
from syne_tune.config_space import randint
from syne_tune.optimizer.baselines import ASHA

# hyperparameter search space to consider
config_space = {
    'steps': 100,
    'width': randint(1, 20),
    'height': randint(1, 20),
}

tuner = Tuner(
    trial_backend=LocalBackend(entry_point='train_height.py'),
    scheduler=ASHA(
        config_space, metric='mean_loss', resource_attr='epoch', max_t=100,
        search_options={'debug_log': False},
    ),
    stop_criterion=StoppingCriterion(max_wallclock_time=15),
    n_workers=4,  # how many trials are evaluated in parallel
)
tuner.run()
```

The above example runs ASHA with 4 asynchronous workers on a local machine.

## Examples

You will find the following examples in [examples/](examples/) folder illustrating different functionalities provided
by Syne Tune:
* [launch_height_baselines.py](examples/launch_height_baselines.py):
  launches HPO locally, tuning a simple script 
  [train_height_example.py](examples/training_scripts/height_example/train_height.py) for several baselines  
* [launch_height_ray.py](examples/launch_height_ray.py):

  scheduler

  in the top 80%
* [launch_height_sagemaker_remotely.py](examples/launch_height_sagemaker_remotely.py):

  the remote machine or distributed again as separate SageMaker training jobs

* [launch_plot_results.py](examples/launch_plot_results.py): shows how to plot
  results of a HPO experiment
* [launch_fashionmnist.py](examples/launch_fashionmnist.py):
launches HPO locally tuning a multi-layer perceptron on Fashion MNIST. This
employs an easy-to-use benchmark convention
* [launch_huggingface_classification.py](examples/launch_huggingface_classification.py):
  launches HPO on SageMaker to tune a SageMaker Hugging Face estimator for sentiment classification
* [launch_tuning_gluonts.py](examples/launch_tuning_gluonts.py):
  launches HPO locally to tune a gluon-ts time series forecasting algorithm
