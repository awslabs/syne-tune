This package provides state-of-the-art algorithms for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) with the following key features:

* Wide coverage (>20) of different HPO methods, including:

  * Asynchronous versions to maximize utilization and distributed versions (i.e., with multiple workers);
  * Multi-fidelity methods supporting model-based decisions (BOHB and MOBSTER);
  * Hyperparameter transfer learning to speed up (repeated) tuning jobs;
  * Multi-objective optimizers that can tune multiple objectives simultaneously (such as accuracy and latency).

* HPO can be run in different environments (locally, AWS, simulation) by changing just one line of code.
* Out-of-the-box tabulated benchmarks that allows you simulate results in seconds while preserving the real dynamics of asynchronous or synchronous HPO with any number of workers.

What's New?
-----------

* New tutorial: `How to Contribute a New Scheduler <tutorials/developer/README.html>`_.
  Learn how to implement your own scheduler, wrap external code, or modify
  one of the existing templates in order to get your job done.
* New tutorial: `Benchmarking in Syne Tune <tutorials/benchmarking/README.html>`_.
  You'd like to run many experiments in parallel, or launch training jobs on
  different instances, all by modifying some simple scripts to your needs? Then
  our benchmarking mechanism is for you.
* You can now
  `do paired comparisons and manage seed choices <tutorials/benchmarking/bm_local.html#random-seeds-and-paired-comparisons>`_
  in order to control randomness in your comparisons.
* The `YAHPO benchmarking <tutorials/benchmarking/bm_simulator.html#the-yahpo-family>`_
  suite is integrated in our blackbox repository
* New benchmark: Transformer on WikiText-2
  (:func:`~benchmarking.commons.benchmark_definitions.transformer_wikitext2_benchmark`)
