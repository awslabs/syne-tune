Benchmarking in Syne Tune
=========================

Benchmarking refers to the comparison of a range of HPO algorithms on one or
more tuning problems, or *benchmarks*. This tutorial provides an overview of
tooling which facilitates benchmarking of HPO algorithms in Syne Tune. The same
tooling can be used to rapidly create launcher scripts for any HPO experiment,
allowing you to easily switch between local, SageMaker, and simulator backend.
The tutorial also shows how any number of experiments can be run in parallel,
in order to obtain desired results faster.

.. note::
   In order to use the *benchmarking* framework, you need to have
   `installed Syne Tune from sources <getting_started.html#installation>`__.
